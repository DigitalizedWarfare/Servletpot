How to install ServletPot

1. read THIS file

2. change information in config.txt /web/WEB-INF/config.txt to match your environment

3. compile it (ANT build script supplied build.xml, adapt Tomcat location, task is DIST)

4. prepare the database by running install.sql

5. deploy the application in the ROOT context of the Tomcat Server

6. for Tomcat 6 and 7, delete the ROOT drawer in the webapps directory

7. run ./import.sh to set up initial page

8. (optional) change the content of /web/index.html, just leave the marker
    <!--flake--> in it



Configuration:


The userevproxy=yes setting in the configfile (default) means, that Servletpot
is checking if the X-Forwarded-For or CLIENT_IP headers are set. If so, the
IP listed here will be used for IP handling. This makes sense, if Servletpot
is run behind a apache server.

Useful apache settings:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.max.html

Header set CLIENT_IP %{REMOTE_ADDR}

ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1/8080/

Means that all requests to / will be rewritten to /homepage.max.html (Tomcat
has some strange behavior when dealing with / URLs).

Additionally the proxypass commands are needed to forward the requests to
the toncat backend.

Servletpot supports custom timezones starting with version 0.34, by entering the timezone field in the
configuration file (default is Europe/Berlin), the honeypot stores the time stamps
in correlation to the local time zone.

Users reported that they use nagios for monitoring the operations and complained
about the not needed log entries, solution starting with version 0.34:

Change the noanswer field in the configuration file to an appropriate value:

noanswer=/your_nagios_request
